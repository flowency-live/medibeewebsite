# Medibee Recruitment Ltd – Website Style & Brand Guidelines (Day 1)

This document defines the **visual, tonal, and brand foundations** for the Medibee Recruitment Ltd website.

The aim is **trust, clarity, and calm professionalism** — not trend-led design or recruitment hype.

---

## 1) Brand positioning (design intent)

Medibee Recruitment Ltd should feel:
- Trustworthy
- Calm
- Human
- Professional without being corporate
- Reassuring rather than sales-led

Design must support **decision confidence** for:
- NHS trusts and procurement teams
- Private healthcare providers
- Healthcare assistants evaluating whether they feel respected

Avoid anything that feels:
- Tech-startup
- Overly corporate
- Salesy or aggressive
- “Agency loud”

---

## 2) Brand personality

**If Medibee were a person:**
- Experienced
- Approachable
- Straight-talking
- Responsible
- Always reachable

This should influence both **visual restraint** and **language tone**.

---

## 3) Colour palette

This palette is **derived directly from the Medibee logo**. It intentionally avoids generic healthcare greens and teals in favour of a calmer, more distinctive slate-and-gold scheme.

### Primary colours
Used for brand identity, key actions, and emphasis.

- **Slate Blue (Primary)**: `#696F8B`
  - Primary brand colour
  - Used for primary CTAs, links, key highlights

- **Deep Slate (Support)**: `#545971`
  - Used for headers, navigation, footer backgrounds, and hover states

### Accent colours
Used sparingly to convey quality and reassurance.

- **Soft Gold**: `#E5D7A2`
  - Used for subtle accents, dividers, and secondary emphasis

- **Rich Gold**: `#D3B25B`
  - Used for highlights, focus states, and limited decorative elements

### Neutral colours
These should dominate the site visually.

- **Mist (Off-White)**: `#E6E3CF`
  - Primary background colour

- **Neutral Grey**: `#9A999B`
  - Used for borders, secondary UI elements, and muted content

### Text colours

- **Primary Text / Ink**: `#09080A`
  - Used for all body copy on light backgrounds

- **Secondary Text**: `#545971`
  - Used for headings, labels, and navigation text

### Functional guidance

- Success states should use **Slate Blue** rather than green
- Warnings and errors should rely on copy and icons first, colour second
- Avoid introducing new semantic colours unless absolutely necessary

🚫 Avoid greens, teals, bright yellows, or saturated blues.

---

## 4) Typography

Typography should be **clean, legible, and familiar**.

### Primary font
- **Inter** (preferred)
  - Excellent readability
  - Neutral and professional
  - Widely accepted in NHS-adjacent products

Fallbacks:
- System UI
- Arial
- Helvetica

### Font usage

- **Headlines**: Inter SemiBold
- **Body copy**: Inter Regular
- **Meta / labels**: Inter Regular or Medium

### Sizing guidance

- H1: 36–42px (desktop), 28–32px (mobile)
- H2: 28–32px
- H3: 22–24px
- Body text: 16–18px
- Small text / meta: 14px (minimum)

🚫 Avoid ultra-light fonts, condensed styles, or novelty fonts.

---

## 5) Layout principles

### Overall layout
- Light background
- Generous white space
- Clear content blocks
- Simple vertical flow

### Page width
- Max content width: ~1100–1200px
- Comfortable line length (no full-width text walls)

### Section spacing
- Clear separation between sections
- Use whitespace, not colour blocks, as the primary separator

---

## 6) Buttons and CTAs

CTAs should feel **calm, confident, and considered** — never urgent or sales-led.

### Primary CTA
Used for main actions only (contact / register).

- Background: **Slate Blue** `#696F8B`
- Text: **Mist** `#E6E3CF`
- Hover: **Deep Slate** `#545971`
- Active / Focus: **Rich Gold** `#D3B25B` (outline or underline only)
- Border radius: Subtle (6–8px)
- Padding: Generous and balanced

### Secondary CTA
- Background: Transparent
- Text: **Slate Blue** `#696F8B`
- Border: **Neutral Grey** `#9A999B`
- Hover: Text and border shift to **Deep Slate** `#545971`

CTA language must be:
- Calm
- Direct
- Non-salesy

Examples:
- “Contact us”
- “Register interest”
- “Request a call back”

🚫 Avoid urgency-driven wording or bright accent fills.

---

## 7) Forms

Forms are a **core trust surface**.

### Form design rules
- Clearly labelled fields (labels always visible)
- Logical grouping of fields
- Single-column layout
- No unnecessary steps

### Field styling
- Soft borders
- Clear focus states
- Error messages in plain English

### Confirmation states
- Clear on-screen confirmation
- Calm success messaging
- No animations or gimmicks

---

## 8) Imagery & visual elements

### Background usage

- Primary page backgrounds: **Mist** `#E6E3CF`
- Section breaks: White or very subtle tonal shifts only
- Headers / footers: **Deep Slate** `#545971` with light text

### Text contrast rules

- Dark text (`#09080A`) only on light backgrounds
- Light text (`#E6E3CF`) only on Deep Slate backgrounds
- Gold tones must never be used for body text

All text must meet comfortable contrast for long-form reading.

### Photography style (if used)
- Real environments
- Real people
- Natural, neutral lighting
- No heavy colour grading

### Illustrations / icons
- Simple, minimal line icons
- Single-colour (Slate Blue or Ink)
- Used sparingly

🚫 Avoid stock-heavy visuals, harsh overlays, or colour filters.

---

## 9) Accessibility

Minimum expectations:
- Sufficient colour contrast
- Readable font sizes
- Keyboard-navigable forms
- Clear focus indicators

Design should be comfortable for:
- Older users
- Tired users
- Users under time pressure

---

## 10) Tone of voice (applies to design & copy)

Design should support copy that is:
- Plain English
- Calm and reassuring
- Honest and direct

No hype. No buzzwords. No pressure.

The site should feel like:
> “You’re dealing with people who take responsibility seriously.”

---

## 11) What this brand is NOT

- Not a tech platform
- Not a volume-driven agency
- Not a marketplace
- Not experimental or edgy

This is a **trust-first healthcare recruitment brand**.

---

## 12) Day‑1 restraint (intentional)

For launch:
- No animation-heavy UI
- No dark mode
- No gradients
- No marketing gimmicks

Elegance comes from **restraint and clarity**.
