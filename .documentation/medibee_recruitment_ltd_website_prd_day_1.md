# Medibee Recruitment Ltd – Website PRD (UK)

## 1) Project goal
Build a clear, trustworthy website that explains what Medibee Recruitment Ltd does and generates enquiries from:
- Healthcare providers needing staff
- Healthcare assistants looking for work

The website must feel professional, friendly, and reassuring, and make it easy for visitors to contact us.

This is a **Day‑1 credibility and enquiry website**, not a platform or system.

---

## 2) Primary actions we want visitors to take

### For care providers
- Complete a contact form (primary action)
- Call our 24‑hour phone line
- Request a call back

### For healthcare assistants
- Complete a contact form (primary action)
- Register interest
- Request a call back

---

## 3) What we do (plain English)
Medibee Recruitment Ltd recruits healthcare assistants for mental health services, acute care, private healthcare, end of life care, and both NHS and private sector organisations.

We operate nationwide across the UK.

**What we do not do**
- We do not deliver care services
- We are not a regulated care provider
- We do not replace a provider’s internal governance, supervision, or training responsibilities

Medibee Recruitment Ltd is a recruitment provider focused on suitability, safeguarding, and reliability.

---

## 4) Ideal customers

### Care providers
- NHS trusts
- Private hospitals and clinics
- Mental health services
- Care homes
- Supported living providers
- Other private healthcare organisations

### Healthcare assistants
- Experienced HCAs
- Newly qualified HCAs
- HCAs looking for flexible or agency work across multiple care settings

---

## 5) Core problems we solve for care providers
Care providers often struggle with:
- Finding reliable healthcare assistants
- Agencies sending staff who are not a good fit for the setting
- Short‑notice cover creating operational stress

Medibee Recruitment Ltd exists to reduce this risk by supplying dependable, suitable healthcare assistants and maintaining clear communication throughout.

---

## 6) Why healthcare assistants choose Medibee
Healthcare assistants choose Medibee Recruitment Ltd because:
- We specialise only in healthcare assistants and the care sector
- We understand care environments and expectations
- We offer flexible shifts and consistent opportunities
- Pay is discussed clearly and fairly on an individual basis
- We treat people with respect and provide proper support

Medibee is not a general recruitment agency. Healthcare is our sole focus.

---

## 7) Coverage
Medibee Recruitment Ltd operates nationwide across the UK, supporting both NHS and private sector healthcare providers.

---

## 8) Trust, compliance and safeguarding
Medibee Recruitment Ltd:
- Is registered with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)
- Carries out DBS checks
- Confirms Right to Work in the UK
- Operates documented safeguarding policies and escalation routes

CQC registration is not required, as Medibee Recruitment Ltd is a recruitment provider rather than a regulated care service.

Medibee does not provide mandatory training directly. Responsibility for role‑specific training remains with the care provider.

---

## 9) Mood, tone and language
The website should feel:
- Professional
- Friendly
- Clear
- Reassuring

Language must be plain English.
Avoid jargon, buzzwords, and sales‑led wording.

## 14) About page

### Intro
Medibee Recruitment Ltd was created to do healthcare recruitment properly.

### Our story
Medibee was founded out of frustration with how many recruitment agencies treat both healthcare staff and care providers. Too often, people are treated like numbers, communication is poor, and decisions are made without understanding the realities of care environments.

### Our approach
We believe healthcare recruitment should be personal, honest, and reliable. As a business, we take responsibility for the service we provide and remain directly accessible to the people we work with.

### What this means in practice
- Clear and consistent communication
- Accountability at every stage
- A focus on suitability, not just filling roles
- Long‑term relationships with clients and healthcare assistants

The About page should focus on the business as a whole, not individual founders.
